# Game of Memory: Swift App Project Plan
---
## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Core Gameplay

- 10 cards face down on the game board
- Each card has a matching pair (5 unique pairs)
- Randomized card locations for each new game
- Flip animation when a card is tapped
- Match animation when two cards are successfully paired
- Game completion screen with score and time

### Game Modes

1. Timed Mode
    - Countdown timer (e.g., 60 seconds)
    - Score based on matches and remaining time
2. Study Mode
    - Allow users to create custom card sets
    - Input interface for adding image-text pairs
    - Option to review created cards before play

### User Profile

- Username and avatar selection
- Personal statistics (games played, best times, etc.)

### Leaderboard

- Personal best scores for Timed Mode
- Sortable by date and score

### UI/UX Design

- Clean, intuitive interface
- Smooth animations for card flips and matches
- Color scheme options (light/dark mode)

## Stretch Goals

### Enhanced Gameplay

- Difficulty levels (Easy: 10 cards, Medium: 16 cards, Hard: 24 cards)
- Power-ups (e.g., reveal a card, extra time)
- Daily challenges with unique card sets

### Multiplayer Features

- Global leaderboard
- Real-time competitive mode (2-4 players)
- Friend system for challenging specific users

### Advanced Study Mode

- Categories for card sets (e.g., languages, science, math)
- Import/export custom card sets
- Spaced repetition algorithm for optimized learning

### Social Features

- Share scores on social media
- Achievements and badges system

### Accessibility

- Voice-over support for visually impaired users
- Customizable card sizes and contrast options

## Technical Considerations

### Swift and iOS Features to Utilize

- SwiftUI for modern, responsive UI design
- Core Data for local data persistence
- CloudKit for user data syncing across devices
- GameKit for leaderboard and multiplayer functionality

### Backend Requirements

- Firebase or custom server for user authentication
- RESTful API for global leaderboard and multiplayer features
- Cloud storage for user-generated content (study cards)

### Performance Optimization

- Efficient image loading and caching
- Smooth animations even on older devices

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Unit tests for core game logic
- UI tests for critical user flows
